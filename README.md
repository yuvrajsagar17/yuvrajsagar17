ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and deep learning frameworks. My passion lies in fine-tuning models and maximizing the use of Nvidia GPUs through custom CUDA kernel optimization.

ðŸ”¬ My current work includes:

- **axolotl-finetune**: In this project, I've implemented simple and multi-GPU finetuning for LLaMA models, conducted Nous evaluation benchmarks, and will soon integrate model quantization techniques.
- **CUDA Kernel Development**: Through my contributions to open-source projects like "llm.c", Iâ€™m focused on writing high-performance CUDA C/C++ kernels to optimize model training on Nvidia hardware.

ðŸš€ I'm also deeply interested in cutting-edge ML research, particularly in the evolution of LLMs and improving their pre-training efficiency.

Feel free to explore my work and repositories!
