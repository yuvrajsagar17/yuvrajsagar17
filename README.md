## 👋 Hi there,

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a strong focus on optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Deep Learning Frameworks. I like fine-tuning, merging and evaluating LLM models. Inspired from [llm.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llm.c) by **Karpathy**, I also love to explore and maximizing the use of Nvidia GPUs through custom CUDA kernel optimization.

# 🔬 My current work includes:

- **axolotl-finetune**: In this project, I've implemented simple and multi-GPU finetuning for LLaMA models, conducted Nous evaluation benchmarks, and will soon integrate model quantization techniques.
- **llama.c**: Implemented LLama3 architecture using custom CUDA C/C++ kernels to attain high-performance for model pretraining on Nvidia GPUs.

🚀 I'm also deeply interested in cutting-edge ML research, particularly in the evolution of LLMs and improving their pre-training efficiency.

Feel free to explore my work and repositories!
